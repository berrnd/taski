# taski
A (very) little web based task/app starter

I wanted to have the possibility to start applications (with parameters) on my server with a simple URL request. Also, a little bit of monitoring (output, exit code, etc.) of the started tasks would be nice. So this is taski.

# How to use
Just unpack on youre PHP enabled webserver, install composer dependencies, copy `config-dist.php` to `config.php` and you're ready to go.

# How to add apps
Applications have to be defined in the apps directory, for instructions see [_ReadMe.txt](taski/apps/_ReadMe.txt) there.
